		Good morning/afternoon. My name is ($user). I am from Shining Hope for Communities,
		an organization that offers health and education programs and services for Kibera and
		Mathare residents.  We are conducting a survey of the people who live in this
		community and therefore your household has been randomly selected to participate
		in this study.
		
		I will ask you questions about the people living in your house: their health,
		relationships, work, education, their use of health and social services during the
		past year. 
		
		Your participation to this survey is completely voluntary and your answers will remain
		confidential. If you have any questions or complaints about this interview please
		contact the Research Manager, Solomon Odero at 0707080734
