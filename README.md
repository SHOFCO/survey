# Editing a survey

* Download TextMate
* Navigate to TextMate > Preferences > Bundles
* Check YAML
* Before editing: Make sure the bottom bar shows "Soft Tabs: 4"
* If part of an entry shows up as white, wrap it in quotes.


# TODO

* Local storage: survey results (1 hour)
* CSV output (1 hour)
* Remaining sections (2 hours)
* Number field min/max support + validation
* Retry / manual entry when GPS fails

Nice to have:

* Local storage: survey in progress (1 hour)
